I am a MTech Coursework student working in the field of computational sciences, currently working under  <a href = "http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/sashi/" target = "blank"> <b>Prof. Sashi Kumaar Ganesan</b> </a> at the department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. 

Founder of H.A.R.S Hitech Engineers (OPC) Pvt. Ltd. which provides 3D design for industrial part and components and studies the computational analysis of machine and parts to enhance the efficiency of clientsâ€™ machinery and components.

My research area includes Multiscale modeling of Fluid Dynamics, Robot Learning and Control System and Time Series modeling using Machine learning and Deep learning techniques.

Apart from research, I enjoy reading Law and Political philosophy , Working out and Cooking.

### Project Description

[Transductive and SDP SVM](https://github.com/AJIISc/Transductive-SVM-and-Semi-definite-programming/ML PROJECT18087.pdf)
Objective is to learn the Kernel matrix from the Dataset which start with transductive approach and conclude it with inductive approach it is possible but computaional expensive unless we figure out iterative SDP solver

---

[One Shot Learning (Facial Recognition)](/sample_page)
Implemented one-shot learning (Siamese network architecture) with triplet loss funtion using keras.
Used pre-trained model to map face images to encodings and performed face verification and face recognition with encodings.

---
[Question Answering using Transformer](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
Visualized how positional encodings affect word embeddings.
Performed Extractive QA to identify the portion of the text that contains the answer to a question and implemented a QA model using TensorFlow.

---
[Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Topic Modelling)](http://example.com/)
Collected recent abstract from arXiv.org under econ.EM category.
Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation using collapsed Gibbs Sampling.

---
[Stock Trend Predictor using LSTM (Multihead Attention) and ARIMA model](http://example.com/)
Used LSTM and Time series forecasting ARIMA method for prediction of trend of Reliance Industires Ltd. stocks over span of 30 yrs.
Compared the prediction of trend of stock price by ML and Statistical model.
